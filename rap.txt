Yo, JavaScript, you’re sloppy, a mess in disguise,
Weak types and bugs, yeah, I see through your lies,
I’m Rust, no mercy, I’m here to slay,
You’re slow on the block, I’m taking your place.

Concurrency beast, I don’t break, I don’t bend,
While your callbacks choke, I race to the end,
Memory leaks? Nah, I shut that down,
You’re the past, JS, I’m the new king crowned.
